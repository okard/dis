# The Dis Runtime Library

The dis programming languages requires some basic constructs to provide the full language feature set.

These components are implemented in the runtime library

The runtime is completly written in Dis.

# Dependencies

To provide some features it is possible to integrate some c libs like zlib or libev.

Additional required C libraries should be compiled als static libs and getting linked into the final runtime shared library

The runtime core should be dis source code only.
